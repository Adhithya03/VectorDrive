\hspace{0.2in}Field-oriented control (FOC) is an advanced technique to achieve high precision torque and flux control in induction motors akin to DC machines. This enables faster dynamic response and efficiency improvements. This project involved MATLAB/Simulink-based modeling and analysis of FOC control on a 5 HP, 400 V, 50 Hz three-phase induction motor with a squirrel cage rotor. The system was simulated with both FOC and conventional scalar VVVF control for comparison. FOC reduced the settling time from 1.7 sec to 0.34 sec and peak overshoot from 20\% to 2\% during load disturbances. However, 30\% longer computation time was needed. Rotor flux angle estimation was also critical, with errors directly impacting performance. The key contribution is a simulation platform to develop and test FOC algorithms before hardware implementation. Results validated that FOC outperforms VVVF control despite greater complexity. Future work should focus on real-time testing and position sensor integration to progress towards a complete motor drive solution. Overall, this project successfully demonstrated a MATLAB/Simulink-based FOC system for induction motors with quantitative performance improvements over scalar control. The simulation model provides a foundation for future prototyping of the algorithm on commercial drive systems.
