\prelimsection{\centering ABSTRACT}


Field-oriented control (FOC) is a sophisticated technique for achieving high-precision torque and flux control in induction motors, offering performance comparable to DC machines. This project involved the design and implementation of a sensorless FOC system for a 0.25 HP induction motor using a Texas Instruments C2000 microcontroller and a Fairchild Intelligent Power Module. Both simulation and hardware implementation were conducted. MATLAB/Simulink was employed to model the FOC system, demonstrating significant improvements in dynamic response, including a reduction in settling time by approximately 80\% and a decrease in peak overshoot by 90\% compared to conventional scalar V/f control. The FOC algorithm was implemented on the C2000 microcontroller, utilizing its ePWM module for Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) generation. The intelligent power module served as the inverter with a built-in gate driver, while current measurement and feedback were achieved using shunt resistors and differential amplifiers. Motor parameters were accurately measured and estimated using specialized equipment for precise control. The implemented system successfully achieved a load angle of 80-87 degrees, maximizing motor torque across the entire speed range, from zero to rated speed. This project effectively demonstrates the superior performance of FOC compared to scalar control.
